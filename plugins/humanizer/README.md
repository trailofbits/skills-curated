# Humanizer

Remove signs of AI-generated writing from text to make it sound natural and human-written.

## Installation

```
/plugin install trailofbits/skills-curated/plugins/humanizer
```

## Usage

The skill activates when editing text that sounds artificial. It detects 24 pattern categories including:

- **Content patterns** - Inflated significance, vague attributions, promotional language
- **Language patterns** - AI vocabulary words, copula avoidance, rule of three
- **Style patterns** - Em dash overuse, inline-header lists, decorative emojis
- **Communication artifacts** - Chatbot phrases, sycophantic tone

The skill includes a two-pass workflow: first rewriting to remove AI patterns, then a self-audit pass ("What makes the below so obviously AI generated?") to catch remaining tells.

## Example

**Before:**
> The software update serves as a testament to the company's commitment to innovation. Moreover, it provides a seamless, intuitive, and powerful user experience. Industry experts believe this will have a lasting impact.

**After:**
> The update adds batch processing, keyboard shortcuts, and offline mode. Beta testers reported faster task completion.

## Key Insight

Removing AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop. The skill also guides adding authentic voice -- opinions, varied rhythm, and specific details.
